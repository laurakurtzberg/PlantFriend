Based on an [example project](https://www.seeed.cc/A+website+to+see+the+environment+data+around+you+-p-1069.html) for the Wio Link, as well as the many benefits I've read about, I decided to create the backend for my project in Node.js.

I know that I could prototype my web app in Heroku, but I've also been exploring using [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com/) for hosting, since that is what I use for my other projects and my [personal website](https://laurajael.com).

There is some documentation available for how to use Node.js on A Small Orange, but it was last updated in 2013.
