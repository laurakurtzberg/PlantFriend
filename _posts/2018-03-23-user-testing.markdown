I completed user testing with 5 participants from my target audience - namely, young people with an interest in technology
and keeping plants alive.

Results from the demographic survey, which was undertaken using Typeform, can be explored at the following link:

Important and informative quotes from the feedback, which reflect opinions repeated by many of the participants, include:
  - "I think it would help to have a summary page with a summary of all the plants"
  - "A social media aspect would be cool to share, and have plants with your friends."
  - "I love the friendship! I like that you give it a personality, it's not just a generic plant."
  - "I want a way to visualize what is the status of the plant each day, I would want to check if I did good or bad!"

  The questions that were asked in the survey included.
  1. Would you use a website like 'Plant Friend'? Why or why not?
  2. What features would make a website like 'Plant Friend' more fun or useful to you?
  3. Do you have any other notes or comments about the 'Plant Friend' website?
  4. What is one thing that would motivate you to re-visit the 'Plant Friend''website?

Conclusion
----------

Users had a lot to say about the design of the actual web app and about the functionality of a project like Plant Friend.
Feedback was mostly positive when users were asked if they would use an app like this, with an important caveat - some
users didn't have an interest in getting and keeping a houseplant. For those who wanted plants but had trouble keeping them
healthy, Plant Friend seemed to be a great fit!
