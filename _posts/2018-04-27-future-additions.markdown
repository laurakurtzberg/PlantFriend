Throughout the final week of classes, the process of presenting Plant Friend to the world, and getting feedback
from users and professors, new plans for growth have emerged. Many of the designs for these ideas have already
been researched but the actual implementation or coding for the new features is still in the future.

* Building out the functionality for many plant friends at once, so that users can have an entire plant friend collection!
* Including a personalization page where users can not only select the kind of plant they have, but also
choose a fun facial expression for each new plant friend they create.
* Adding functionality for editing the settings for the environmental variables, so that if users observe that their plant
does better with different conditions other than those coded in for their type of plant, or if they have a type of plant that
isn't in the preset options, they can modify the app to work for their plant.
* Modifying the data visualizations to always give users cues to what their goal ranges are for environmental variables. This way users can always identify if they are 'in the green'.
* Giving the plant friend an online presence on social media. Using a tool like IFTTT, the plant's personality can come through on posts that speak in it's own voice. For example "I got watered today and I feel great!"
