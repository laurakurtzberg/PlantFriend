Hello! My name is Laura Kurtzberg and I am so excited to share my capstone project with you.

Summary of the Capstone project
===============================

For people hoping to coexist among plants, but lacking a green thumb, 'smart' gardening has stepped in to help keep plants alive and thriving. From automatic watering devices to mobile apps that keep track of your plants while you travel, technology is expanding in the world of personal urban gardening. Plot Garden seeks to use data to help people garden, without losing site of the fundamentally slow, even spiritual, quality of interacting with plants. Gardening can be therapeutic, but the use of technology often forgoes the personal journey in favor of fast solutions. Plot Garden will consist of two parts - the automated collection of data from a personal garden, and the expression of that data through a web platform that will use information design to monitor the health of the garden, as well as the relationship between plants and gardener. In this way, the user will create a continuously updated work of data art through their gardening.
