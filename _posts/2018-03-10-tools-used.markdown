![Tools used for this project]({{ "/img/plantfriendtools.png" | absolute_url }})

Tabletop.js
===========
Tabletop.js is a javascript library to help people connect their javascript code to data inputted from or outputted to google spreadhseets. To use it the only requirement is a spreadsheet that has been published on google and has link sharing turned on. Read more about tabletop.js or use it by visiting [the github repo](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) or [the npm package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletop).

Tabletop.js does have its limitations, however. For more information about that, [here](https://gist.github.com/jsvine/3295633) is a blog post and accompanying debate about using tabletop in production.

Github
======
Github is, according to [Github.com](https://github.com/), a web-based hosting service for version control using git. What, then, is [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)? Git is a version control system used for tracking changes and updating code in software developemnt.
[This](https://www.quora.com/What-is-GitHub-for-a-beginner-and-how-do-I-get-started-with-it) question on quora.com is a good introduction to
what Git and Github are all about. I used Github throughout the capstone project to share and keep track of my website, my demos, and my blog posts. For this documentation process blog, I used [Github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)and jekyll to create the blog website.

Node.js
=======
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is, according to their own website, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment. The answers
on [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js) provide more information and discussion.

Heroku
======
Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what) "is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps ... the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches". Read more about my research in deciding to deploy my node.js app demo on
heroku in [my previous post](http://laurakurtzberg.github.io/PlantFriend/blogpost/2018/03/30/node-and-heroku.html).

Inkscape
========
I used the freely available and open source vector images editing software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/download/?lang=it) to create my logo and my wireframes. Inkscape exports to many file formats, including svg.


Grove Sensors and Wio Link
==========================
To read more about the sensors and physical computing tools that I used for Plant Friend, please see [this previous blog post](http://laurakurtzberg.github.io/PlantFriend/blogpost/2018/03/01/choosing-wio.html)
