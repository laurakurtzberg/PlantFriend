Personal Urban Gardening Monitoring and Inspiration through Data Art

Summary
-------

For people hoping to coexist among plants, but lacking a green thumb, 'smart' gardening has stepped in to help keep plants alive and thriving. From automatic watering devices to mobile apps that keep track of your plants while you travel, technology is expanding in the world of personal urban gardening. Plant Friend seeks to use data to help people garden, without losing site of the fundamentally slow, even spiritual, quality of interacting with plants. Gardening can be therapeutic, but the use of technology often forgoes the personal journey in favor of fast solutions. Plant Friend will consist of two parts - the automated collection of data from a personal garden, and the expression of that data through a web platform that will use information design to monitor the health of the garden, as well as the relationship between plants and gardener. In this way, the user will create a continuously updated work of data art through their gardening.


Project Scope
-------------

The vision of Plant Friend grew from a desire to showcase the power of using information design to communicate scientific information. Additionally, the goal of this capstone is to provide an example of how a positive impact can be made on everyday life using insights gained from data. For this reason, the design and implementation of the data visualization web app is the main focus of what I hope to accomplish. A visualization web app like this is needed because it demonstrates that innovations from the world of data journalism are applicable to every kind of data analysis, especially conceptual and artistic projects. It is unique because it is the only project to bring together ideas from the urban gardening movement, DIY smart devices, 'life-logging', and infographics design.

Objectives
----------

1. Implement principles of both plant science and visual design: the interdisciplinary nature of the interaction between the garden and the web app should lend itself to an exploration of concepts from the worlds of science and art simultaneously.

2. Create a reproducible and remixable project: this goal includes writing documentation, publishing openly available code, and in general maintaining a focus on personalization so that anyone can set out to implement the idea for their own gardens.

3. Demonstrate skills I learned in the Interactive Media MFA program: I plan to use a variety of tools such as Arduino, D3.js, and 3D Modeling to create a multi-faceted project that showcases more than one skill.
